### Making Mods For MTT
**You can make mods for MTT in 2 diffrent ways!**
Theres the old way, for V1 MTT, the only way to make mods was manually, this worked, but was not very easy or simple in any way...  
**(This tottaly dident get superseeded by a new system because it was too confusing and i forgot how it worked...)**

---

### Method 1: The old way:
⚠️ NOTICE: it is advised to only use this way if you for some reason are making mods for a older version of MTT that dosent support the new mod creator, Or you wanted to do it this way for some reason... ⚠️
#### Step 1:
Open your MTT game directory
> (i would say where it is normally located but i have no idea, im writing this before ive made it... dont question it!).
   
within that directory, go into the `main` folder, then into `mods`.   
once your in the `mods` directory, create a new folder and name it whatever you want your mod to be called, for this example ill call it `mymod1`.
once you have done that, you will need a text editor, for this you can use just normal notepad, but we suggest you use a [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (Intergrated Development Enviroment).   
popular IDE's include Visual Studio Code, which can be downloaded from the official visual studio code website [here!](https://code.visualstudio.com/), its free and works very well!

inside Visual Studio (Or your proffered text editor/IDE), go to `file` in the top menu bar (These steps may vary slightly depending on the text editor/IDE) and go to `open folder` (Or somthing simmilar), then navigate your MTT directory, and the new mod folder you just created.   

once you have opened that folder in your text editor/IDE, you can go to `file` again, and click `create new file` (or if your using VS code, right click in the explorer on the left, and select `new file`), then name that new file `modinfo.yaml`.   
> This step is very important that it is `modinfo.yaml` exactly, or MTT will **Not** pick it up, and your mod wont function correctly! if your mod dosent seem to be working, cheak that you dident do `Modinfo.yaml` with a capital M or somthing simmilar!
